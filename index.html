      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Like almost anything humans do, it started with a curiosity. While I've used computers for about 3/4 of my life, I've never really understood how people design and implement the miriad of applications and websites that are literally available at our fingertips. After doing some self-directed learning with (amazing) online resources, I started working with some very basic code and shortly after I was hooked. I love the logic behind the algorithms, the patterns inherent in the various langages that, once you know how to read them, seem to make perfect sense. Even though I most certainly don't yet understand much of the code that's out there, I can see and appreciate the inherent simplicity in it. The computer does what you tell it to do... you just need to find the right words. Therein lies the puzzle and I can't wait to solve it.</p>
